Why Lvl\U/p rather than a "Coding School"?
==========================================

Technology changes quickly. Who would have predicted programmable lightbulbs? Self-driving cars smarter than a 1990's supercomputer? Being able to map concepts learned today to future developments is essential to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise!
 
The "Lvl\U/p" workshop series is based on the video game concept of "leveling up", where one's character gains new awesome abilities and tools to surmount the next challenge. Unlike coding schools that teach specific skills and frameworks, we teach students how to approach and master new technologies. We empower participants with conceptual understanding of and practical experience with key concepts and skills, giving them a soild foundation to build internet software on today while preparing them to launch their own learning journeys tomorrow. 

Our innovative approach to teaching builds students' confidence and interest in software development processes through:

* A fun, supportive, and interactive environment
* On-the-level conceptual and technical discussions
* Engaging activities like "You Can Tell the Rubber Duck (It's OK)" and "Peanut Butter and Jelly Machine"
* Adoption of cutting-edge technologies like [Ruby-on-Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Docker](https://docker.io/), [Cloud9](http://c9.io), and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* Exposure to web development fundamentals and processes used by software professionals
