Code of Conduct
================

LvlUp Workshops are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, religion, or other attributes. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

1. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

2. All communication should be appropriate for a classroom audience including people of many different backgrounds. 
3. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students.

4. Behave with courtesy. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Students asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Students continuing to violate these rules may be dismissed from the workshop at the sole discretion of the instructor without refund of any charge that may have been levied. 

This code of conduct is a modified version of that used by Software Carpentry, based on a template used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.
